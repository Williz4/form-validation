## Description

Form validation is a simple HTML form with common validation checks done on the form

## How To Interact with the Application
* The site is located at the url https://williz4.github.io/form-validation/

* Once you click on the submit button I have used the preventDefault method to prevent the form from automatically refreshing.
* I then take all the values via JS and perform checks to check if they are empty and return an error under the input field. Also the form checks the length of the values passed in and if they aren't within the stipulated range it returns an error. Also the regexp method is used to check if the email is valid and finally if the two password fields values match, if they do not match an error is once again returned.

## Known  Bugs
Currently there are no known bugs in the Bankist application

## Technologies Used
I used HTML for the sites structure and CSS for the styling and visual presentation and finally JS for the functionality.
